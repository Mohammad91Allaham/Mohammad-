    <h3>HTML first day</h3>
    <p>● &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; — Emphasis.
        By default, text inside &lt;em&gt; is displayed as italic , and text in <strong> is displayed as
            boldface .
            ● &lt;p&gt; — Paragraph.
            Text in a paragraph is separated visually from other paragraphs by a small margin.
            A line break does not create a new paragraph; it only marks the end of a line.
            Not very often used, but it's kind of cool .
            Of these elements, the br element is the only one that is an empty (or void) element.
